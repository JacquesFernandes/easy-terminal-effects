#About
Simple way to implement special effects to your text in your terminal
 - Source material: http://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting

#Usage
 - If it's your first time using this code, either read the docs or import and run the "Effect.sample()" function
 - Using an effect function returns the formatted string
 - Adding text to the string will add plain text to the end of the formatted string (no effects will have been applied)
